# Deep Learning for Solar Flare Prediction Using R

[Troy Hernandez](http://www.TroyHernandez.com) spent the summer at NASA Ames mentoring the [Frontier Development Lab](http://frontierdevelopmentlab.org); Solar Storm Prediction Team to create a deep learning system capable of predicting solar flares. This talk will cover:

* Working with Python developers using the Reticulate and Feather packages 

* Deep learning options in R (mxnet and tensorflow)

* Deep learning hardware

* Engineering considerations required for dealing with petabytes of satellite data

Snacks and drinks will be served at the IBM offices (71 S. Wacker Dr).

Please submit first and last names when RSVP-ing to get past building security.&nbsp; RSVP deadline is September 5, Tuesday 5:30pm.
